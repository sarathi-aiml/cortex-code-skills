description: "**[REQUIRED]** Use for ALL requests that mention: create, build, debug, fix, troubleshoot, optimize, improve, or analyze a semantic view — AND for requests about VQR suggestions, verified queries, verified query representations, or seeding/generating queries for a semantic view. This is the REQUIRED entry point - even if the request seems simple. DO NOT attempt to create, debug, or generate VQR suggestions for semantic views manually - always invoke this skill first. This skill guides users through creation, setup, auditing, VQR suggestion generation, and SQL generation debugging workflows for semantic views with Cortex Analyst."

# Semantic View Skill

## When to Use

When a user wants to create, debug, optimize semantic views, or generate VQR (verified query) suggestions for Cortex Analyst. This is the entry point for all semantic view workflows including VQR suggestion generation.

## Prerequisites

- Fully qualified semantic view name (DATABASE.SCHEMA.VIEW_NAME)
- Snowflake access configured
- Python dependencies: `tomli`, `urllib3`, `requests`, `pyyaml`, `snowflake-connector-python`
  - Install via: `uv pip install tomli urllib3 requests pyyaml snowflake-connector-python`

## ⚠️ MANDATORY INITIALIZATION (Required Before ANY Workflow)

**Before creating, auditing, or debugging semantic views, you MUST complete initialization:**

### Step 1: Load Core Concepts ✋ BLOCKING

**Load**: [semantic_view_concepts.md](reference/semantic_view_concepts.md)

\*After loading, confirm you understand:\*\*

- Logical vs physical table/column names
- Which semantic model elements can be added vs enhanced only
- Required use of semantic_view_get.py and semantic_view_set.py tools

**DO NOT PROCEED until you have loaded semantic_view_concepts.md.**

### Step 2: Complete Setup ✋ BLOCKING

**Load**: [setup/SKILL.md](setup/SKILL.md)

**This will:**

- Get BASE_WORKING_DIR from user (where to create files)
- Create session directory WORKING_DIR (timestamped)

**After setup completes, you will have these variables:**

- `SKILL_BASE_DIR` - Script location
- `BASE_WORKING_DIR` - User's chosen base directory
- `WORKING_DIR` - Session directory: `{BASE_WORKING_DIR}/semantic_view_{TIMESTAMP}`

**DO NOT PROCEED until setup is complete.**

### Step 3: Workflow Routing and Available Skills ✋

**After setup completes**, you will be routed to the appropriate workflow based on whether you're working with a NEW or EXISTING semantic view.

#### Supporting Skills Available

Throughout any workflow, you can load these supporting skills as needed:

**Validation**:

- **Load**: [validation/SKILL.md](validation/SKILL.md)
- **Purpose**: Validation procedures used by both audit and debug workflows
- **When to use**: To validate semantic models before applying changes

**Optimization Patterns**:

- **Load**: [optimization/SKILL.md](optimization/SKILL.md)
- **Purpose**: Library of optimization patterns for semantic view improvements
- **When to use**: When you need guidance on specific optimization techniques

**Upload**:

- **Load**: [upload/SKILL.md](upload/SKILL.md)
- **Purpose**: Upload optimized semantic view YAML to Snowflake
- **When to use**: Only when user explicitly requests deployment to Snowflake

**Time Tracking** (Optional):

- **Load**: [time_tracking/SKILL.md](time_tracking/SKILL.md)
- **Purpose**: Track execution time for tool calls and workflow steps
- **When to use**: Only if user explicitly requests time tracking

**⚠️ After setup, refer to Core Capabilities below for detailed information on each workflow.**

## Core Capabilities

**The setup will route you to the appropriate workflow. See below for details on each capability.**

### Creation Mode

Create new semantic views from scratch with proper structure, relationships, and validation using table metadata and VQRs (SQL Queries).

**When to use**: User wants to CREATE a new semantic view (not optimize an existing one)

**Action**: Load [creation/SKILL.md](creation/SKILL.md)

### VQR Suggestions

Generate verified query suggestions by mining Cortex Analyst usage and Snowflake query history. Runs both modes in parallel and merges results.

**When to use**: User wants to suggest, generate, seed, or populate VQRs for a semantic view — including right after creation

**Action**: Load [vqr_suggestions/SKILL.md](vqr_suggestions/SKILL.md)

### Optimization, Audit, and Debug

For working with EXISTING semantic views.

**When to use**: User wants to optimize, audit, or debug an existing semantic view

**Action**: Continue in setup/SKILL.md (Part 3)

#### 1. Audit and Optimize Loop

Comprehensive audit system for semantic views including:

1. VQR testing
2. Best Practices verification
3. Custom Criteria evaluation

**Load**: [audit/SKILL.md](audit/SKILL.md) when user chooses AUDIT MODE

#### 2. Debug Loop

Targeted problem-solving for specific issues with SQL generation from natural language queries.

**Load**: [debug/SKILL.md](debug/SKILL.md) when user chooses DEBUG MODE

## Supporting Skills

### Validation

**Load**: [validation/SKILL.md](validation/SKILL.md) - Validation procedures used by both audit and debug workflows

### Optimization Patterns

**Load**: [optimization/SKILL.md](optimization/SKILL.md) - Library of optimization patterns for semantic view improvements

### Time Tracking (Optional)

**Load**: [time_tracking/SKILL.md](time_tracking/SKILL.md) - Track execution time for tool calls and workflow steps (only load if user explicitly requests time tracking)

### Upload

**Load**: [upload/SKILL.md](upload/SKILL.md) - Upload optimized semantic view YAML to Snowflake (only load when user wants to deploy/upload)

**See above for supporting skills available throughout any workflow.**

## Key Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Load skills incrementally as needed
2. **Modularity**: Each skill is self-contained and reusable
3. **User Confirmation**: Stop at mandatory checkpoints for user input
4. **Validation First**: Always validate before applying changes

## Rules

1. **⚠️ Test Locally First**: By default, test with local YAML files using `semantic_model_file` parameter. Only upload to Snowflake when user explicitly requests deployment.
2. **⚠️ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT FOR ALL OPTIMIZATIONS**: Before any actual semantic view optimization:
   - Wait for explicit user approval (e.g., "approved", "looks good", "proceed")
   - NEVER chain separate optimization edits without user approval between them
3. **⚠️ Always use `uv run python` for scripts**. DO NOT use `python script.py` or `python3 script.py`.
