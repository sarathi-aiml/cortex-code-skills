# GLOBALORGADMIN & ORGADMIN Reference

Authoritative reference for Snowflake globalorgadmin role.

## Two Ways to Administer an Organization

Snowflake provides two roles for organization-level tasks:

| Role | Where It Runs | Status | Recommended |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GLOBALORGADMIN** | Organization account only | Active — preferred | ✅ Yes |
| **ORGADMIN** | Any ORGADMIN-enabled account | Being phased out | ⚠️ Legacy |

**For multi-account organizations, always use GLOBALORGADMIN in the organization account.** ORGADMIN in regular accounts is being phased out. Snowflake will send notification emails at least three months prior to phasing out the ORGADMIN role.

## GLOBALORGADMIN

### What It Is

The GLOBALORGADMIN role is the preferred role for performing organization-level tasks. It is available in the **organization account** only. A user with this role is also known as the **global organization administrator**.

### How to Use It

1. Sign in to the **organization account**.
2. Switch to the GLOBALORGADMIN role:

```sql
USE ROLE GLOBALORGADMIN;
SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
```

If `CURRENT_ROLE()` does not return `GLOBALORGADMIN`, the user does not have the role granted. Check grants:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS TO USER CURRENT_USER();
```

### Who Should Have GLOBALORGADMIN

- Organization administrators responsible for multi-account governance
- Users who need to view organization-wide usage, cost, and security data
- Users who manage account lifecycle (create, alter, drop)
- Users who manage organization users and user groups

## GLOBALORGADMIN: Full Capability Catalog

### 1. Cost Governance

As GLOBALORGADMIN you have visibility into all spending across the entire organization.

| Capability | SQL / View | What You Can See |
|---|---|---|
| Total org spend | `SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY` | Daily spend by account, service type, currency |
| Compute credit consumption | `SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY` | Credits used/billed by service type per day |

| Contract and balance | `SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE.CONTRACT_ITEMS` | Contract terms, committed amounts |
| Remaining balance | `SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE.REMAINING_BALANCE_DAILY` | Daily remaining credit balance |

**Key focus areas:**
- **Spend concentration** — identify which accounts drive the most cost
- **Runaway warehouses** — find warehouses burning credits disproportionately
- **Service sprawl** — track AI, Snowpipe, serverless, and other service costs growing quickly

### 2. Security Posture

Full visibility into authentication patterns, admin sprawl, and trust center findings across every account.

- **SSO adoption** — track SAML vs password vs OAuth login ratios
- **Trust Center violations** — critical and high-severity findings needing remediation

### 3. Account Lifecycle

Complete control over the organization's account inventory.

| Capability | SQL Command | What It Does |
|---|---|---|

## ORGADMIN (Legacy)

### What It Is

The ORGADMIN role allows organization-level tasks from **any ORGADMIN-enabled account**, not just the organization account. It is being **phased out** for multi-account organizations.

### How to Use It

1. Sign in to an ORGADMIN-enabled account.
2. Switch to the ORGADMIN role:

```sql
USE ROLE ORGADMIN;
SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
```

### Enabling ORGADMIN in an Account

The first account in an organization has ORGADMIN enabled by default. To enable it in other accounts:

```sql
USE ROLE ORGADMIN;
ALTER ACCOUNT <account_name> SET IS_ORG_ADMIN = TRUE;
```

**Rules:**
- The `ALTER ACCOUNT` syntax only accepts the **account name format** of the account identifier — you cannot use the account locator.
- By default, ORGADMIN can be enabled in a **maximum of 8 accounts**. Contact Snowflake Support if you need more.
- ORGADMIN **cannot** be enabled for reader accounts.

### Disabling ORGADMIN in an Account

To prevent an account from performing organization-level tasks:

1. Sign in to a **different** ORGADMIN-enabled account.
2. Execute:

```sql
USE ROLE ORGADMIN;
ALTER ACCOUNT <account_name> SET IS_ORG_ADMIN = FALSE;
```

**Rules:**
- Must be run from a different ORGADMIN-enabled account — you cannot disable it from the account being modified.
- The `ALTER ACCOUNT` syntax only accepts the **account name format** — not the account locator.
- You **cannot** disable ORGADMIN if it is the last account that has the role enabled. Contact Snowflake Support in that case.

## ORGADMIN vs GLOBALORGADMIN

| Aspect | ORGADMIN | GLOBALORGADMIN |
|---|---|---|
| Level | Account-level role | Organization-level principal |
| Scope | Operates within an ORGADMIN-enabled account | Operates in the organization account |
| Where it exists | Inside a Snowflake account | The organization account |
| Granted via | `GRANT ROLE ORGADMIN TO USER <name>` within account | `GRANT ROLE GLOBALORGADMIN TO USER <name>` in org account |
| Can create accounts | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Can view ORGANIZATION_USAGE | ✅ Yes (from ORGADMIN-enabled account) | ✅ Yes |
| Can manage org users/groups | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Status | Being phased out | Preferred |

## Decision Guide

When user asks "which role should I use?" or "how do I perform org-level tasks?":

| Scenario | Recommended Role |
|---|---|
| Multi-account organization, any org-level task | GLOBALORGADMIN in the organization account |
| Need to view ORGANIZATION_USAGE data | GLOBALORGADMIN (required) |
| Need to manage organization users/groups | GLOBALORGADMIN in the organization account |
| Legacy setup, single-account org operations | ORGADMIN (but recommend migrating to GLOBALORGADMIN) |
| User asks about ORGADMIN specifically | Acknowledge it exists, note it is being phased out, suggest GLOBALORGADMIN |

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't switch to GLOBALORGADMIN"
- Confirm the user is signed in to the **organization account**, not a regular member account. GLOBALORGADMIN only exists in the organization account.
- Check if the role is granted: `SHOW GRANTS TO USER CURRENT_USER();`
- The role must be explicitly granted by another GLOBALORGADMIN user.

### "ORGANIZATION_USAGE views say schema does not exist"
- The user is not using GLOBALORGADMIN. Run `USE ROLE GLOBALORGADMIN;` first.
- Or the user is in a regular account, not the organization account.

### "ALTER ACCOUNT fails with invalid identifier"
- The `ALTER ACCOUNT` command requires the **account name format**, not the account locator.
- Use: `ALTER ACCOUNT my_account_name SET ...`
- Do NOT use: `ALTER ACCOUNT AB12345 SET ...`

### "I want to enable ORGADMIN in more than 8 accounts"
- The default limit is 8 ORGADMIN-enabled accounts. Contact Snowflake Support to increase.
