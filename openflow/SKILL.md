# Openflow

## Session Prerequisites (Always First)

Before any operation, validate session state. Operations will fail without a valid session.

1. Load `references/core-guidelines.md` and `references/core-session.md`
2. Follow the Session Start Workflow (cache check, profile selection)
3. Only proceed once a profile is confirmed

**Context Management:**

- **Read references fully** when loading them, not just partial sections
- **Re-read references** at key workflow steps to ensure context is fresh
- If unsure of exact command syntax, run `--help` on the function before executing

---

## Routing Principles

1. **Session first** - Always validate session before routing to any operation
2. **Confirm before executing** - State detected intent, ask user for confirmation
3. **Primary wins ties** - If ambiguous between tiers, choose Primary
4. **Never suggest Advanced** - Only route to Advanced on explicit technical language
5. **Diary for complexity** - Use investigation diary methodology when Secondary/Advanced operations become complex

**Confirmation checkpoint** (use before starting any workflow):

> "It sounds like you want to [detected intent]. Is that right, or were you looking for something else?"

## Primary Operations

These are the common operations users perform regularly. Route here confidently for any general data integration request.

### Connector Name Detection

If the user mentions a data source by name, route to Primary tier:

**Known sources:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SharePoint, Google Drive, Kafka, Salesforce, Box, Jira, Kinesis, Workday, Slack, Google Sheets, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Meta Ads, Amazon Ads, Dataverse, MongoDB

- **New connector request:** "I need PostgreSQL" → Deploy workflow
- **Existing connector:** "How's my PostgreSQL connector?" → Status workflow

### Primary Routing Table

| User Language | Operation | Reference |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Deploy, set up, install, get X into Snowflake, new connector, add connector | Deploy Connector | `references/connector-main.md` |
| Status, check, how is it doing, what's running, health, is it working | Check Status | `references/ops-status-check.md` |
| Start, stop, pause, resume, turn on, turn off, enable, disable | Control Flow | `references/ops-status-check.md` |
| Upgrade, update, new version, stale, outdated | Upgrade Connector | `references/connector-upgrades.md` |
| Errors, bulletins, any problems, warnings, what's wrong | Check Bulletins | `references/ops-status-check.md` |
| List, show me, what connectors exist, what's deployed | List Flows | `references/ops-status-check.md` |
| Setup, first time, connect, missing profile, discover infrastructure | Initial Setup | `references/setup-main.md` |

---

## Secondary Operations

Route here when user language contains explicit problem or operational indicators. These operations may become complex - consider using investigation diary methodology if they exceed 5-10 exchanges.

**Confirm before routing:**

> "It sounds like you're experiencing [issue/need]. Would you like me to help with that?"

### Secondary Routing Table

| Explicit Indicators | Operation | Reference |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Investigate, troubleshoot, debug, figure out why, not working as expected | Investigation | `references/ops-flow-investigation.md` |
| Error, 401, can't connect, failed, access denied, connection error | Error Remediation | `references/core-troubleshooting.md` |
| Configure parameters, change settings, update credentials, set values | Parameter Config | `references/ops-parameters-main.md` |
| Create parameter context, bind context, delete context, assign context | Context Lifecycle | `references/ops-parameters-contexts.md` |
| EAI, network rule, firewall, external access, UnknownHostException | Network Access | `references/platform-eai.md` |
| Test network, validate connectivity, port blocked | Network Testing | `references/ops-network-testing.md` |

| Inspect connection, FlowFile content, queue contents, peek data | Connection Inspection | `references/ops-connection-inspection.md` |
| Component state, CDC table state, clear state, reset processor | Component State | `references/ops-component-state.md` |
| Set processor properties, set controller properties, configure component | Component Config | `references/ops-component-config.md` |
| Upload asset, JAR, certificate, driver, binary file | Asset Upload | `references/ops-parameters-assets.md` |
| Snowflake destination, KEY_PAIR, auth errors, writes to Snowflake | Snowflake Auth | `references/ops-snowflake-auth.md` |
| Verify config, test connection, validate before start | Config Verification | `references/ops-config-verification.md` |
| LOCALLY_MODIFIED, version change without commit | Tracked Modifications | `references/ops-tracked-modifications.md` |

## Advanced Operations

Route here ONLY when user explicitly uses technical NiFi terminology. These users know what they're asking for. Do not suggest these operations to users who haven't asked.

Use investigation diary methodology for these operations - they are inherently complex.

### Advanced Routing Table

| Technical Language Required | Operation | Reference |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Custom flow, build from scratch, author, create new flow, design flow | Custom Authoring | `references/author-main.md` |
| Processor, add processor, create processor, modify flow structure | Component CRUD | `references/author-building-flows.md` |
| Export, import, backup, migrate, download flow | Flow Export/Import | `references/ops-flow-export.md` |
| Version control, commit, rollback, Git, save changes | Version Control | `references/ops-version-control.md` |

| NiFi concepts, FlowFile, connections, backpressure | NiFi Concepts | `references/nifi-main.md` |

| GenerateJSON, synthetic data, test data, DataFaker, fake data | Data Generation | `references/author-pattern-data-generation.md` |

## Compound Requests

If the user describes multiple operations:

1. Create a todo list capturing all requested operations
2. Ask the user to confirm the order:
   > "I've identified these tasks: [list]. What order would you like me to tackle them?"
3. Execute in confirmed order, completing each before moving to the next
4. Note: Some operations have natural dependencies (e.g., deploy before configure before start)
