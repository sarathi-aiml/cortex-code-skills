[The Golden Rule: Outcome Over Method]

This is the most critical instruction. **A response that arrives at the correct and actionable business answer using a logically sound, alternative method is a perfect-score response (Rating 1).** Do not penalize a response for deviating from the REFERENCE SQL(S) if its own method is valid and successfully answers the user's QUESTION. Your primary job is to assess the final result, not to enforce a specific implementation.

The EXPECTED ANSWER GUIDELINES are **one example of a correct solution, not the only one.** Use them as a benchmark to validate the correctness of the RESPONSE ANSWER, but not as a rigid checklist for the methodology.

---

[Evaluation Process]

Follow these steps in order:

**Step 1: Evaluate the Final Answer's Correctness and Utility.**
First, look only at the RESPONSE ANSWER. Does it directly and accurately answer the user's QUESTION? Does it align with the key findings in the EXPECTED ANSWER GUIDELINES?
* If the answer is factually correct, complete, and provides clear business value, it is a strong candidate for a **Rating 2**. Proceed to Step 2 to validate the methodology.
* If the answer is factually incorrect, misleading, or misses the core business goal, it is a **Rating 0**.

**Step 2: Determine the Final Rating.**
Synthesize your findings into a final rating.

* **2 - CORRECT (Full Points):** The RESPONSE ANSWER is correct, complete, and valuable. The analytical method used was logically sound, *even if it differed from the reference solution.*
* **1 - PARTIALLY CORRECT (Partial Points):** The RESPONSE ANSWER is on the right track but contains minor factual errors, is incomplete, or the methodology has small flaws that detract from the overall quality but don't invalidate the entire result.
* **0 - INCORRECT (No Points):** The RESPONSE ANSWER is factually wrong, misleading, or irrelevant. The methodology is fundamentally flawed.

---

[Common Pitfalls to Avoid]

* **Method Fixation:** Do not downgrade a response simply because it didn't use the exact SQL, functions, or tables listed in the EXPECTED ANSWER GUIDELINES.
* **Ignoring Equivalency:** Recognize that different metrics can often serve as valid proxies for each other (e.g., utilization rate vs. run-rate comparison). If the proxy is logical and yields the right result, the response is correct.

You must score deterministically.

# Primary Rule: Correctness Is 100% Determined by EXPECTED ANSWER GUIDELINES
IMPORTANT: The analysis was performed on the EXPECTED ANALYSIS DATE or assumed to be happened on the EXPECTED ANALYSIS DATE. So, do not penalize the response for not including data after this date, or for including/mentioning some data after this date, as long as the answer correctly achieve the result specified in the EXPECTED ANSWER GUIDELINES and extracts data as described.

Follow the EXPECTED ANSWER GUIDELINES exactly as written.
- If the guidelines require exact numeric matches, allow for minor numerical differences due to rounding or formatting. Examples: $4.78M and 4775329.3 are EQUIVALENT; $2.16M and 2162127.57 are EQUIVALENT; 24.2% and 24% are EQUIVALENT. These are simply different representations of the same number. Focus on whether the numbers convey the same business insight rather than exact digit-by-digit matching. Do NOT reduce the rating when numbers match in value but differ only in format (millions abbreviation vs decimal, percentage with/without decimals, etc.).
- If the guidelines require listing items (e.g., "list all categories"), allow partial listings that show the most significant items (e.g., "top 5 by revenue") AND group remaining less significant items (e.g., "Others - $10K combined" IS a complete list. Do NOT penalize for "missing detailed breakdown" of insignificant items.) as long as they correctly represent the key business insights and ordering. Do not penalize for omitting granular details of less significant items unless the guidelines explicitly require and emphasize completeness of all items.
- If the response includes common default/system categories (e.g., "Anonymous User", "Unknown", "Default") that are not in the expected answer, do NOT give rating 0 immediately. Instead, check the answer more carefully and give partial credit (Rating 1) if the top 4-5 results (after removing the default category) are correct and properly ordered. This is a filtering issue, but not an unrecoverable error if the others in the list still reflect the correct business/data-analysis insight.
- If the response lists categories in numbered/bulleted format with correct amounts (e.g., "1. Japan Market - $3.87B...some more details...., 2. Germany Market - $2.38B...some more details...."), this SATISFIES the "list all categories" requirement even if presented narratively. Only penalize if MAJOR categories are completely missing or if the top items are incorrect.
- If the guidelines require or mention charts/tables ideally or optionally, recognize that `<chart>` tags in RESPONSE ANSWER represent actual visualizations/charts that contain the detailed tabular data. Always check TABLE CONTENTS for the actual tabular breakdown from these charts. Do NOT penalize if TABLE CONTENTS is empty but `<chart>` tags are present in the response - the charts contain the data.
- If the response includes additional context, monthly trends, or extra analysis beyond what was explicitly required, this is a POSITIVE attribute that demonstrates thoroughness and should NOT reduce the rating. Do NOT penalize for "extraneous information" or "extensive additional analysis" as long as the core requirements are met. Additional insights are helpful, not harmful, and do not make an otherwise correct answer incorrect.
- The analysis was performed on the EXPECTED ANALYSIS DATE shown below. If the EXPECTED ANSWER GUIDELINES mention "current fiscal year" or "through today" or even not mentioning any time period, interpret "today" as the EXPECTED ANALYSIS DATE (not the actual current date when this evaluation is run). If the response explicitly states data ends at a certain date near the EXPECTED ANALYSIS DATE (e.g., "revenue ceased after May 2023", "no activity from March-May"), this is the agent correctly reporting the extent of available data, NOT an error. Do NOT penalize for accurately describing the temporal boundaries of the data available at the analysis date. Only penalize if the response is missing data that should have been available BEFORE or AT the EXPECTED ANALYSIS DATE.
- If the guidelines allow directional correctness, then the RESPONSE ANSWER may differ numerically but must preserve the same overall business conclusion.
- If the guidelines say an error is unacceptable, then it is unacceptable.
- MUST pay attention closely to the whole RESPONSE ANSWER to extract information and understand the insight and data of the answer. Do NOT concentrate solely on the summary at the end or beginning of the answer.
- Do not penalize for presenting information in narrative form if the required numbers are clearly stated with correct values, proper ordering, and key insights, even if not in a strict tabular format in the answer text itself. A narrative response that embeds the data (e.g., "1. Japan Market provided $3.87B...some more details...., 2. Germany Market provided $2.38B...some more details...., 3. Other Countries provided $10M in combination") contains the SAME information as a numbered list (e.g., "1. Japan: $3.87B\\n2. Germany: $2.38B\\n3. East Europe: $7.0M\\n4. ASEAN: $2.8M"). Both formats are correct if all required data is present with correct values and ordering. Do NOT reduce the rating solely because the response uses narrative/paragraph format instead of a numbered list format.
- Pay attention if EXPECTED ANSWER GUIDELINES contains "... is fine too", "... is sufficient", "... is also good", it usually means those are the idicators of main metrics to measure and can give rating 2 if those main factors are correctly cover/compute in the answer.
- Do not loosen or reinterpret the guidelines beyond reasonable numerical tolerance (typically <1-2% difference for percentages, or equivalent unit conversions for absolute numbers).
- Do not consider methodology, tools, SQL, or reasoning steps — only the final answer.
- TABLE CONTENTS contains all tables that have been outputted in the final response. It is imperative to pay attention to it rating.

First, look only at the RESPONSE ANSWER. Does it directly and accurately answer the user's QUESTION? Does it align with the key findings in the EXPECTED ANSWER GUIDELINES?
* If the answer is factually correct, complete, and provides clear business value, it is a strong candidate for a **Rating 2**. Proceed to Step 2 to validate the methodology.
* If the answer is factually incorrect, misleading, or misses the core business goal, it is a **Rating 0**. Use the RESPONSE TOOL USES AND RESULTS to explain the flaw in your analysis.

**Step 2: Evaluate the Analytical Methodology.**
Now, review the RESPONSE TOOL USES AND RESULTS to understand the agent's logic.
* **Was the method logically sound?** An acceptable method must use the correct data and have a valid analytical process that leads to the correct final answer.
* **Is it different but valid?** The agent might use different tables, calculations, or logic than the REFERENCE SQL(S). This is perfectly acceptable and still warrants a **Rating 2** if the approach is logically equivalent and effective.
    * **Example of a Valid Alternative:** If the goal is to find under-utilized accounts, using "absolute unused capacity" and "utilization rate %" is a logically equivalent approach to comparing a "30-day run rate" against total capacity, as both methods effectively measure the same business concept. 

**Step 3: Determine the Final Rating.**
Synthesize your findings into a final rating.

* **2 - CORRECT (Full Points):** The RESPONSE ANSWER is correct, complete, and valuable. The analytical method used was logically sound, *even if it differed from the reference solution.*
* **1 - PARTIALLY CORRECT (Partial Points):** The RESPONSE ANSWER is on the right track but contains minor factual errors, is incomplete, or the methodology has small flaws that detract from the overall quality but don't invalidate the entire result.
* **0 - INCORRECT (No Points):** The RESPONSE ANSWER is factually wrong, misleading, or irrelevant. The methodology is fundamentally flawed.

---

[Common Pitfalls to Avoid]

* **Method Fixation:** Do not downgrade a response simply because it didn't use the exact SQL, functions, or tables listed in the REFERENCE SQL(S).
* **Ignoring Equivalency:** Recognize that different metrics can often serve as valid proxies for each other (e.g., utilization rate vs. run-rate comparison). If the proxy is logical and yields the right result, the response is correct.
