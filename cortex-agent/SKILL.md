description: "**[REQUIRED]** Use for ALL requests that mention agents: list, show, create, build, set up, edit, modify, update, delete, drop, remove, download, export, debug, fix, troubleshoot, optimize, improve, evaluate, or analyze a (Cortex) agent. Also use when debugging Snowflake Intelligence with a request ID (SI is powered by Cortex Agents). This is the REQUIRED entry point - even if the request seems simple. DO NOT attempt to debug (Cortex) agents manually - always invoke this skill first. This skill guides users through listing, creating, editing, deleting, downloading, auditing, evaluating, and debugging workflows for (Cortex) agents."

# Main

## When to Use

When a user wants to list, create, edit, delete, download, debug, evaluate, or optimize a (Cortex) agent. This is the entry point for all (Cortex) agent workflows.

## Setup

1. **Load** `agent-system-of-record/SKILL.md`: Required first step for all sessions.
2. **Load** `best-practices/SKILL.md`: Required to help maintain best practices for agent development.

⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY INSTRUCTION: Before modifying an agent check with a user if it is a production agent and offer to create a clone. Ask user for the **fully qualified clone name** (`DATABASE.SCHEMA.CLONE_AGENT_NAME`) where they want the clone created. Follow `agent-system-of-record/SKILL.md` for clone creation. 

## Intent Detection

When user makes a request, detect their intent and load the appropriate sub-skill:

**CREATE Intent** - User wants to create/build a new agent:

- Trigger phrases: "create agent", "build agent", "set up agent", "new agent", "make an agent"

- **→ Load** `edit-cortex-agent/SKILL.md`

**ADHOC_TESTING Intent** - User wants to test questions interactively:

- Trigger phrases: "test questions", "try queries", "test agent", "run some questions"
- **→ Load** `adhoc-testing-for-cortex-agent/SKILL.md`

## Rules

### Running Scripts

When running any scripts in any of the above skills, make sure to do all of the following:

1. **Check if `uv` is installed** by running `uv --version`. If it's not installed, prompt the user to install it using one of these methods:
   - `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (recommended)
   - `brew install uv` (macOS)
   - `pip install uv`
2. When running python scripts, use `uv run --project <DIRECTORY THIS SKILL.md file is in> python <DIRECTORY THIS SKILL.md file is in>/scripts/script_name.py` to run them.
3. Do not `cd` into another directory to run them, but run them from whatever directory you're already in.
   WHY: This maintains your current working context and prevents path confusion. When using `uv run --project`, you must provide absolute paths for BOTH the --project flag AND the script itself.
4. Just run the script the way the skill says. Do not question it by running `--help` or reading the script unless the script fails when run as intended.

#### Common Mistakes When Running Scripts

1. ❌ WRONG: `uv run --project <DIRECTORY THIS SKILL.md file is in> python scripts/test_agent.py ...`
   (Relative path to script will fail)
2. ❌ WRONG: `cd <DIRECTORY THIS SKILL.md file is in> && uv run python scripts/test_agent.py ...`
   (Violates the "don't cd" rule)
3. ✅ CORRECT: `uv run --project <DIRECTORY THIS SKILL.md file is in> python <DIRECTORY THIS SKILL.md file is in>/scripts/test_agent.py ...`
   (Use the same base directory for both --project and the script path)

### System of Record

**Load** `agent-system-of-record/SKILL.md`.
