# Cost Intelligence Skill

> **Do NOT search for semantic views for cost questions.**  
> Cost data lives in `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` views, not user-created semantic views.  
> Skip `cortex semantic-views search/discover` and `SHOW DATABASES` — go directly to the routing table below.

> **⚠️ Budget Syntax Warning**  
> Budgets are **class instances**, NOT standard objects. Never use `SHOW BUDGETS` — it will fail.  
> ✅ Correct: `SHOW SNOWFLAKE.CORE.BUDGET LIKE '...'` or `SHOW SNOWFLAKE.CORE.BUDGET INSTANCES IN ACCOUNT`  
> ❌ Wrong: `SHOW BUDGETS LIKE '...'`

> **⚠️ Account Budget Limitations**  
> The **account budget** (`SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL.ACCOUNT_ROOT_BUDGET`) monitors ALL account spending automatically.  
> It does **NOT** support tag or resource management methods:  
> - ❌ `ADD_RESOURCE`, `REMOVE_RESOURCE`, `GET_LINKED_RESOURCES`  
> - ❌ `ADD_RESOURCE_TAG`, `REMOVE_RESOURCE_TAG`, `GET_RESOURCE_TAGS`, `GET_BUDGET_SCOPE`  
> If the user asks about tags/resources on the **account budget**, tell them immediately this isn't supported.  
> They need a **custom budget** to track specific objects or tags.

## Routing

Match the user's question to keywords and read the corresponding file **before writing any queries**.

| "expensive queries", "query costs", "costly queries", "parameterized hash", "query patterns", "grouped by hash" | `references/queries/users-queries.md` |
| "where is my money going", "cost breakdown", "credits by service", "overall spending" | `references/queries/overview.md` |
| "warehouse", "compute", "virtual warehouse", "warehouse costs" | `references/queries/warehouse.md` |
| "week over week", "month over month", "cost increase", "spike", "why did costs go up", "compared to last" | `references/queries/trends.md` |

**Never write ad-hoc queries when a verified query exists in the routed file.**
