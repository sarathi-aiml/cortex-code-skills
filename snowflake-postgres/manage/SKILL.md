# Snowflake Postgres - Manage

## When to Load

From `snowflake-postgres/SKILL.md` when intent is MANAGE.

**Note:** All `<SKILL_DIR>` placeholders must be absolute paths.

## Workflow

### List Instances

```sql
SHOW POSTGRES INSTANCES;
```

Present results showing name, state, compute_family, storage_size_gb.

If the user wants to import connections, compare instance names to saved connection names and offer to add missing ones:
```bash
uv run --project <SKILL_DIR> python <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/pg_connect.py --list
```

### Describe Instance

```sql
DESCRIBE POSTGRES INSTANCE <instance_name>;
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** DESCRIBE response contains credentials in `access_roles`.
- DO NOT display raw SQL results
- Show only: name, state, host, port, database, compute_family, storage_size_gb

### Create Instance

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT** - Creates billable resources.

#### Step 1: Gather Requirements

**Load** `references/instance-options.md` for valid options.

**Ask** user with ready-to-go defaults:
```
I'll create a Postgres instance with these defaults:

  Name:     pg_[timestamp]
  Size:     STANDARD_M (1 core, 4GB)
  Storage:  10 GB
  HA:       Off

Type yes to proceed, or tell me what to change.
Type "options" to see all available configurations.
```

**If user says "options":** Use `ask_user_question` to show what they can change:
```
What would you like to configure?

1. Instance size (currently: STANDARD_M)
2. Storage (currently: 10 GB)
3. High availability (currently: Off)
4. Postgres version (currently: latest)
5. Network policy (currently: none)
```

If the user asks for sizes or limits, load `references/instance-options.md`.

**If user gives partial info:** Merge with defaults and confirm.

#### Step 2: Validate Parameters

Validate against `references/instance-options.md`:
- Compute family exists and matches type (Standard/Burstable/HighMem)
- Storage within limits (Burstable max 100GB)
- HA not available for Burstable instances
- Network policy exists if specified

#### Step 3: Get Approval

Present full configuration to user:
```
I will create a Postgres instance:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Name | [name] |
| Compute | [compute_family] ([cores] cores, [memory]) |
| Storage | [size] GB |
| Postgres | [version] |
| High Availability | [Yes/No] |
| Network Policy | [policy_name or "None - configure after"] |

⚠️ This creates a billable resource.
Proceed? (yes/no)
```

**NEVER proceed without explicit approval.**

#### Step 4: Execute

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Use `pg_connect.py --create`** - this is the ONLY way to create instances that does not show passwords. Do NOT use `snowflake_sql_execute` or any SQL tool. The script:
1. Executes CREATE SQL internally
2. Fetches CA certificate via DESCRIBE (for `sslmode=verify-ca`)
3. Saves connection to `~/.pg_service.conf` with cert verification
4. Saves password to `~/.pgpass` automatically
5. Never exposes passwords or certificate content in chat

**Do NOT ask the user if they want to save the connection - the script saves automatically.**

```bash
uv run --project <SKILL_DIR> python <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/pg_connect.py \
  --create \
  --instance-name <name> \
  --compute-pool <compute_family> \
  --storage <size> \
  [--auto-suspend-secs <seconds>] \
  [--enable-ha] \
  [--postgres-version <version>] \
  [--network-policy <policy_name>] \
  [--snowflake-connection <name>]
```

**Parameters:**
- `--compute-pool` - `STANDARD_M`, `STANDARD_L`, etc. (not `STANDARD_S`)
- `--storage` - Size in GB (10-10000)
- `--auto-suspend-secs` - Inactivity timeout (optional)
- `--enable-ha` - Enable high availability
- `--postgres-version` - Postgres version (e.g., 16)
- `--network-policy` - Network policy name (must exist)
- `--snowflake-connection` - Snowflake CLI connection name (optional)

**Extended parameters:** If the user requests parameters not supported by the script (e.g., `MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_START`), consult `references/documentation.md` for current syntax and use raw SQL via SQL tool (but warn user credentials will be visible).

#### Step 5: After Success

**⚠️ Do NOT run `--reset` after CREATE.** The `--create` script already saved the password. RESET is only for rotating passwords later.

The script already saved the connection and fetched the CA certificate. Just relay the script's output to the user:
> ✅ Created **[name]** ([compute], [storage]GB)
> ⏳ Instance is provisioning (1-2 minutes)
> ✅ Connection saved to `~/.pg_service.conf`
> ✅ Password saved to `~/.pgpass`
> ✅ CA certificate saved, `sslmode=verify-ca`
> Connect with: `psql "service=[name]"`

If the cert line shows a warning instead, the connection still works with `sslmode=require`. The cert can be fetched later with `pg_connect.py --fetch-cert --instance-name [name]`.

Then offer network policy setup (can do while provisioning):
> Would you like to configure network access so you can connect?

### Suspend Instance

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT** - Get approval first, then execute.

**Step 1:** Present to user what will happen:
```
I will suspend [instance_name]. This will:
- Stop compute billing (storage billing continues)
- Drop all active connections

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

**Step 2:** After user approves, execute:
```sql
ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE <instance_name> SUSPEND;
```

### Resume Instance

```sql
ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE <instance_name> RESUME;
```

Note: May take 3-5 minutes. Connection string remains the same.

### Reset Credentials (Rotate Password)

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT**

Before attempting reset, verify the instance exists and you have access. See the connect skill for workflows.

Explain impact:
```
I will reset credentials for [instance_name] and role [role_name]. This will:
- Generate a new password for the role (only `snowflake_admin` or `application`)
- Invalidate the old password (existing connections may drop)

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

**⚠️ After approval, use `pg_connect.py --reset` (NOT `snowflake_sql_execute`)** - the script handles the SQL internally and updates ~/.pgpass. Executing RESET via SQL tool would expose the new password in chat.

```bash
uv run --project <SKILL_DIR> python <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/pg_connect.py \
  --reset \
  --instance-name <instance_name> \
  [--role <role_name>] \
  [--host <host>] \
  [--snowflake-connection <name>]
```

- Supported roles: `snowflake_admin` (default) and `application`.
- `--host` - Creates service entry if missing (use host from DESCRIBE)
- `--snowflake-connection` - Snowflake CLI connection name (optional)

## Output

- List/Describe results (safe fields only)
- Confirmation of create/suspend/resume
- Import guidance for local connections file update

For LIST results:
- Let the SQL result table speak for itself, but you may mention they need to use ctrl+t to expand the table
- Add only a brief summary: count + any notable states (e.g., "8 instances, 2 suspended") and offer to show other details
- Don't create a second markdown table
